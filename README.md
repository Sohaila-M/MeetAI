# MeetAI
The development of the video conferencing application, enhanced with advanced features such as real-time captioning, translation, and post-meeting summaries, represents a significant step forward in communication technology. This project leverages the power of modern web technologies, AI models, and real-time communication protocols to create a user-friendly and feature-rich platform akin to Google Meet, but with additional functionalities that address common user needs.
The project incorporates the following key components:
•	Front-End Technologies: Utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a responsive and intuitive user interface. WebRTC was employed for real-time video and audio communication.
•	Back-End Technologies: Implemented Flask to manage server-side logic and integrate AI models for captioning, translation, and summarization. Python-based AI models were used to provide real-time captions and translations, enhancing accessibility and understanding for users from diverse linguistic backgrounds.
•	Real-Time Communication: Employed Socket.io to enable seamless real-time communication between the client and server, ensuring live updates for captions, translations, and other interactive features.
•	APIs: Developed APIs to facilitate communication between the front-end and back-end components, ensuring smooth data exchange and integration of various functionalities.
•	Advanced AI Features
-	Real-Time Captioning: Leveraging speech-to-text technology, the platform provides real-time captions for spoken content, ensuring that all participants, including those with hearing impairments, can follow the discussion.
-	Real-Time Translation: Utilizing the deep-translator package and GoogleTranslator model, the application offers real-time translation of captions, making the meeting accessible to users who speak different languages. This feature promotes inclusivity and ensures effective communication in a multicultural environment.
-	Summarization: Implementing the facebook/bart-large-cnn model, the platform generates concise post-meeting summaries. These summaries capture key points and action items, helping participants quickly review important discussions and follow up on tasks. A separate thread transcribes the audio in real-time, writes it to a text file, and after the meeting, the transcription is summarized and translated, with both versions added to the summary text file for easy access.
The application successfully demonstrates the potential of combining WebRTC, Flask, and advanced AI technologies to enhance the traditional video conferencing experience. By providing real-time captions and translations, the application significantly improves accessibility and inclusivity. The post-meeting summary feature ensures that key information is easily retrievable, making meetings more productive and reducing the chances of missing important points.
